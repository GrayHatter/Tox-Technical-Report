Technical Report
==========

The Tox Technical report attempts to explain the protocol, the design of the network, and rationale of decisions when designing the library in a highly technical manner, providing rigorous proofs for every statement made, through references, benchmarks, heuristics, algorithms or mathematics.

This report is in ``latex`` format, and may be converted into ``pdf`` format by installing any LaTeX distribution such as ``texlive`` (Unix) or ``miktex`` (Windows) and running either ``xelatex tox`` or ``pdflatex tox`` in case your distribution does not include xetex for some reason and the first command is unavailable.

This report is also compiled on commit and hosted in ``pdf`` format at at https://tox.im/TechnicalReport.pdf
